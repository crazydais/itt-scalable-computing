/*	Part 4:
	--------
To build a program to compute the arithmetic mean and variance (lecture) of an array of integers in C/C++

1. First, we will consider how to allocate space to an array (lecture)
2. We need to set the values of the array once the space has been allocated (lecture).
3. Look at how to design a function in C/C++ (lecture)
4. To design the appropriate function parameter list, we need to look at the objective of the function:
(a) calcAvg 
(b) calcVar
5. Take some time to design the function "prototype"
6. Write the calcAvg and calcVar
